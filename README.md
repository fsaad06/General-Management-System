# General-Management-System
Open Sourced Management System involving Oriented Oriented Programming, Exception Handling, STL and much more


A management system is a set of policies, processes and procedures used by an organization to 
ensure that it can fulfill the tasks required to achieve its objectives. Based upon requirements, it 
can be transformed into various like School Management System, Hospital Management 
System, Parking Management System and much more. But they all somehow share common 
base characteristics (classes).


The aim is to develop a pratical General Management System, covering all above mentioned 
forms, ultimately empowering it to be used as cross-platform, free and open-source software.
Softwares to be used:

✓ Microsoft VS Code

✓ MSYS-64

✓ CMake

Technically, almost all management systems share base classes, like Person.h, Record.h and 
Account.h. These can be coded in Global Directory once, instead of individually coding in each 
sub-Directory.
This program will be implemented using Object Oriented Programming techniques.


• Firstly, individual systems will be compiled to make .exe files, using CMake and 
MSYS64 (Cyber- Attacks will be minized, practically).

• A global GUI-like terminal will be developed to call and run pre-compiled .exe files , 
based upon user requirement.
